  <title>Matrices - Definition</title>

  <p>  For each of the following matrices, decide if they are in row-reduced echelon form; recall that a $*$ marks any possible entry (zero or non-zero).
    
    \item If yes, describe the outcome of the associated system (unique sol, no sol, multiple solutions).
    \item if not, explain why not and what step(s) are needed to put it into row-reduced echelon form.
    \end{itemize}
     </p>
